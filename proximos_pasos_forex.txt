You're on a solid track! Your script already:

âœ… Loads and preprocesses Forex data
âœ… Builds and trains an LSTM neural network
âœ… Generates buy/sell signals based on predictions and technical indicators
âœ… Runs a backtest with stop-loss/take-profit logic
âœ… Logs trades and performance
âœ… Works on both Windows 10 and Fedora 42

Since your **goal is to earn money with Forex**, the next logical steps involve *transitioning from research to live or semi-live use*. Here's a step-by-step game plan:

---

### âœ… **1. Validate Your Strategy Thoroughly (Backtest More!)**

You need to:

* Try multiple timeframes (e.g., M5, M15, H1)
* Test on various currency pairs
* Run walk-forward validation or k-fold backtesting
* Evaluate **sharpe ratio**, **drawdown**, **win/loss ratio**, etc.

ðŸ“¦ Add metrics to your backtest script. Want help with that?

---

### ðŸ”„ **2. Add Paper Trading / Simulated Live Trading**

Before risking real money, simulate in real time:

* Use free data streams (e.g., [MetaTrader 5 demo](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/trading-platform/demo) or brokers with demo accounts)
* Track trades using your signal logic in live conditions
* Log latency, slippage, unexpected behavior

ðŸ‘€ This helps you *stress test* the logic in the real world.

### ðŸ“¡ **3. Integrate with a Broker (API Trading)**

Once your strategy holds up:

* Use APIs like **MetaTrader 5**, **OANDA**, or **Alpaca** (for stocks)
* Or write a MetaTrader Expert Advisor (EA) that reads your signal files

ðŸ§  You could output `Buy/Sell` from Python to a `.csv`, then have MetaTrader EA read that file and place trades.

Would you like a small MT4/MT5 EA to read your predictions and trade?

---

### ðŸ§  **4. Improve Strategy with More Features**

Your LSTM uses:

* Price + SMA, EMA, RSI

Nice! But you can add:

* MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, Heikin-Ashi
* Candle patterns or custom features
* News sentiment or time-of-day bias

More features = richer input, but beware overfitting.

---

### ðŸ›  **5. Add Risk Management Tools**

Right now you use stop-loss/take-profit and capital size.

Consider:

* Max daily loss limits
* Max concurrent trades
* Position sizing using volatility
* Portfolio-level risk metrics

---

### ðŸ’° **6. Go Live (Small Size First!)**

When ready, fund a real account with a **small** amount (like \$100 or \$500). Start with:

* Micro lots (0.01 lot)
* Low leverage
* Focus on execution, not returns at first

Track everything. Journal your trades, both automated and manual.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Your Immediate Next Step

Since your script is strong already, Iâ€™d suggest:

> âœ… **Step 1: Add walk-forward validation and performance metrics to your backtest.**

Then:

> âœ… **Step 2: Build a small script to simulate paper trading using recent data every X minutes.**

If you'd like, I can help:

* Add those metrics
* Build an MT4/MT5 bridge
* Make a simple live trading loop
